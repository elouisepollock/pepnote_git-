## 3 - Problem Definition and Solution

## 4 - Problem 
Presently buying or selling tickets to concerts in Australia is carried out over a number of websites not tailored to concert tickets. This can present a number of difficulties when searching for or buying tickets locally. 

## 5 - Solution
Second Show is an online market place for buying and selling concert and show tickets that will provide added features specific for this kind of transaction.

### Why in Australia
When buying or selling tickets to smaller shows and concerts it can be hard to get connected with relevant buyers or sellers if platforms are spread across to many countries without adequate focus and hence concentration in each area.

### Why specific to tickets
A lot of online marketplaces have a section for tickets but are focused on accomodating a large range of categories. This leaves websites with a lack of features that are specific to tickets, for example, the function to upload links and to online tickets.

### What is wrong with sites that already exist
These sights are not focused only in Australia with all of the required features for ticket buying and selling.
